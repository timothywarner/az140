Is it a good sign Mamasan asked me for my phone number?

Hello fellow hobbyists. The AMP scene in my city is as dry as a bone, but I finally found a place that might have potential. On my second visit a super sexy Mamasan (I assume she was the Mamasan because she was behind the front desk and gave orders to the other girls at the spa) gave me the best massage and tease I've had in a long time.

Here's a breakdown of my one-hour "body massage" session:

- I barely covered my ass with the drape, and Mamasan eventually took it off me entirely for most of our session

- She oiled up my legs and ass and spent a long time rubbing between my cheeks and lightly touching my junk. She wasn't shy about rubbing my hole - it felt awesome.

- One the flip she giggled when she saw my raging boner. While she sensuously rubbed my chest she took my hand and placed in on her ass. This is NOT your stereotypical Mamasan, gentlement - she had breast implants and a tight, bubbly ass. She let me feel her up and squeeze to my heart's content.

- At the 40 min mark Mamasan took me to another room for a table shower. Eventually she moved my hand to my cock, signally do-it-yourself (DIY). No, Homey don't play that. I can't even cum that way at an AMP. A couple times I tried to place her hand on my pole, but she just kept moving my hand back to it. That sucked. "Sorry!" she said.

- After Mamasan dried me off and gave me a nice head/foot massage, we were done. She said "Sorry!" again, hugged me, and kissed me on the lips with a closed mouth. At this point I'm not sure what to think.

Here's the kicker, and why I'm posting this message: Mamasan was evidently impressed that I tipped her the full amount of the massage because before we said goodbye she said, "Wait here," got her phone, and asked me for my phone number. We had traded names earlier as well.

Question: What do y'all think this means? Of course I'm hoping I'm now elevated to premier status and have a better chance of a HE or FS next time around. I welcome your feedback! Thanks.
